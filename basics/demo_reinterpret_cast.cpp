Basically, static_cast can cast between types that the compiler thinks are "related". Numerical types are related; the compiler will actually generate the machine instructions to convert between different number formats that have the same value. Also, void* is related to any pointer-to-object type.

reinterpret_cast tells the compiler to treat a bit pattern for one type as the value for another *unrelated* type. But it doesn't work for things that make no sense at the architecture level with reinterpret_cast. The compiler will disallow it if you tell it simply reinterpret the bit pattern for an int value as a double value. 

However, reinterpret_cast allows you to cast between unrelated pointer types - you tell the compiler to reinterpret the address in the pointer as the address of another type of object altogether, such casting a pointer to an integer as a pointer to a double (even if it doesn't make sense), or a pointer to an S1 type object as a pointer to an S2 type object. In addition, if you want to cast an integer to a pointer value, you have to use reinterpret_cast - they aren't considered as related types.


Finally, function pointers of different types are also "not* related; so if you want to cast a function pointer to another function pointer type, you need to use reinterpret_cast to do it. 

Remember that in C++ we don't need to play these wild casting games anywhere near as often as in C, so using reinterpret_cast is actually pretty rare.
